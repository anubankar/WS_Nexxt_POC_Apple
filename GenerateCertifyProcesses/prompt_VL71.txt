    Important Instructions:
- First Step should be entering SAP TCode, for eg. ("VA01") in ok code field on SAP Main Screen
- Find SAP Program name for the SAP TCode, for e.g. VA01 program name is SAPMV45A and first screen is SAPMV45A:0101
- Then get the objects on SAPMV45A:0101 screen from screen mapping provided and add them in JSON
- Then move on to next screen and add objects for next screen in JSON. Before moving to next screen, add navigation step by pressing enter or click on a tab
- Make sure to add objects specified in description and on screen they exist as per the mapping
