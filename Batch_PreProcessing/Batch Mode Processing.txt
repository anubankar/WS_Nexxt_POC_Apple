=> Batch Mode Processing
Imagine 200 documents batch

PRE-PROCESSING:
1. Read all the documents
2. Extract Sections and bifurcate by Tcode and description. 
	Note: 
	a. For signavio, all the steps will be description
	b. For Fiori, Tcode is App Number
	c. DOCUMENT CAN BE IN DIFFERENT FORMAT. So we might have to use LLM to extract relevant sections
	d. For Signavio, Procedure Section Table Headings are same so its easy to extract Signavio Documents

	For e.g
	1st Document => VA01 - Create Sales Order
	2nd Document => VA01 - Go to VA01, then enter Order Type, Ship to Party, Sold to Party
					VA02 - xxxxx
	3rd Document => VA01 - Create

	Load all these combinations to Neo4J Or Sql Db

	LOGIC:
	- Read Sub Folder Files one by one
	- Check file format excel or docx
	- If Docx then check if Section Procedure with table headings as signavio exists or not
      expected_headers = ['Test Step #', 'Test Step Name', 'Instruction', 'Expected Result', 'Pass/Fail/Comments']
	  If its signavio document then use TransAlta code to extract sections / tables.
	  Refer CreateSteps_andActions_New.py line no 333
	- If it is excel document, then read rows. if every row has different TCode then save them as separate section. For e.g.
	  Apple excel document has 22 sections
	- Store this information into Neo4j.
		Document Name, TCode, Description

3. Find Unique Variants based on TCode and Description
For e.g.
Out of 200 documents: 
VA01 => Total Variants => 50
		Unique Variants => 5
		
4. Now collect all these unique Variants, create a excel from it in the format of Standard Export Sales Order Flow_AllRows.xlsx.
Use it in human in the loop. This will create Processes for all unique variants.

5. Also we find the Reference process if there for that unique variants and, 
add it excel document with ProcessID and Similarity score 

6. Now when we batch process, we will already have Reference Processes ready
So accuracy will improve as Step generation is not needed for most of the scenarios

7. Create a simple excel report, showing:
Total Documents,
Total Sections per TCode / Fiori App Number,
Unique Variants per TCode / Fiori App Number,
ProcessID applicable per Variant

Total Documents		TCode	Variant_ID 	Unique_Variant_Or_Not	ProcessID
200		

*ProcessID can be filled even if its not unique, based on ProcessID for Unique Variant

8. Neo4J should get updated after Certify is batch loaded OR user changes any Processes directly in Certify

Open Question: 
1. Will the variant have impact based on the context of the document? for e.g. 2 documents has same line Create Sales Order but the expected steps in them are different and are based on document context. Decide how we will handle this?
2. Create new ProcessID always or reuse existing if found. (this will be decided as per client need)
3. DOCUMENT CAN BE IN DIFFERENT FORMAT. So to handle it on UI, we can have a API that returns TCode, and Description to UI
